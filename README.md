- Issue: If you press the wrong button on the elevator you cannot unpress that button

- The issue is bad becoues it forces you to stop at a floor you don't want to if you make a mistake.

##B:

- Common uses of an elevator are changing floors, and opening/cloasing elivator door. more rare uses are calling for help and setting the alarm off.
The example interface makes it more dificult to get to the correct floor.

- The common interaction with an elivator is; a user enters the elevator, selects a floor, waits for the elevator to get to the right
floor, let the doors open, exit the elevator.

- The elevator tells the user what floor they are on, if they are going up or down, and what floors it will stop at

- Some common mistakes you can make with the design are hitting the wrong button, trying to go down when the elivator is goin up, and getting off on 
the wrong floor.
